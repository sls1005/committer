# Committer

A helper for committing your changes.

It can only be used in a repo with some changes to be committed. Once invoked, it will help to commit and push, by invoking the `git` command. Note that all files in the same directory will be added automatically.

The knowledges for using `git` are not required, but you still have to know how to clone a repo, to use command line, and to generate a token for use instead of the password
